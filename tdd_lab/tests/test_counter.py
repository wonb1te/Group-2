"""
Test Cases for Counter Web Service

Create a service that can keep a track of multiple counters
- API must be RESTful - see the status.py file. Following these guidelines, you can make assumptions about
how to call the web service and assert what it should return.
- The endpoint should be called /counters
- When creating a counter, you must specify the name in the path.
- Duplicate names must return a conflict error code.
- The service must be able to update a counter by name.
- The service must be able to read the counter
